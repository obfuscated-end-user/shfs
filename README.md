# About
Simple HTTP file server written in Python 3.11. I made this because my device's USB port is unreliable, making file transfers between other devices difficult and a pain to manage.

# How to run
Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed.  
Double click the file and open the link provided on your browser.

Another way is to go to the folder where the program is located, open the terminal there, and type:
```
py shfs.py
```
And do the same thing as above.  

This program doesn't work on Python 3.13.
